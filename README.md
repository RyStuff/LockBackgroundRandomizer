RyStuff Lock Background Randomizer
==================================
RyStuff Lock Background Randomizer is a basic windows powershell, registry, Scheduled task and batch files that randomize lock screen backgrounds everytime you logon the computer.

**Note: **At the moment a powershell window will appear at logon. I am working on a good way to make the window not appear.
